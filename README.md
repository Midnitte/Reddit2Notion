# How to get started
First you will need to register a [Reddit Application](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/) and make a new [Notion Integration](https://developers.notion.com/),. Copy your Notion token, Reddit ID, Secret, password, and username into a `.env` file.
```
NOTION_TOKEN=""
REDDIT_ID=""
REDDIT_SECRET=""
REDDIT_PASSWORD=""
REDDIT_USER=""
```

In Notion, create a new database called `Test Reddit`. You can then run the script.
